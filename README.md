# Stock Price Predictor
In this project I will apply different regression models using yfinance library. Yahoo finance website: https://finance.yahoo.com
This project was made with help of FreecodeCamp Machine Learning course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWONeJKn6kc&t=10601s

The problem statement:
 - to determine the closing price of the stock.

The goal of this project:
 - practice building linear regression, ridge regression, support vector regressor and decision tree regressor using Scikit-learn;
 - compare these models on this particular task;
 - try implementing GridSearchCV on SVR;
 - try implementing cost complexity pruning on decision tree.
